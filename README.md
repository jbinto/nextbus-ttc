# nextbus-ttc

A fork of the [nextbus gem](https://github.com/neweryankee/nextbus), which was originally written in 2010 by Greg Sterndale for Boston's MBTA.

A lot has changed since 2010. When the gem was written, NextBus only supported 3 transit agencies. Now it supports a few dozen. 

The purpose of this fork is to get the gem running on modern (c. 2014) ruby, and to make any changes needed to support the TTC (Toronto's transit agency).
